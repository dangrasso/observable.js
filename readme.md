observable.js

Observable.js is a tiny library (gzipped less then 1.4KB) that makes knockout's gorgeous observables available without the bloat of whole knockout.js framework. As this is tested against knockout's own unit tests, it is designed to act as a drop in replacement for knockouts subscribable, observable and computable. I developed this to embed observables into my own js integration testing framework. Surely you can imagine other places where some observables might be usefull :-)
